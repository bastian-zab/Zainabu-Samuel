## Why Transcription Matters  

Transcription and captioning are vital for creating inclusive content. At Echo Labs, the focus isn’t just on transcribing speech but also on capturing the tone, emotion, and intent to provide equitable access to all viewers, including those who are deaf or hard of hearing.

With legal mandates like the **Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)** and an ever-growing demand for accessibility, high-quality transcription ensures:  
- **Equal Access**: Students and audiences with diverse needs can engage with content.  
- **Compliance**: Institutions meet legal requirements for accessibility.  
- **Enhanced Learning**: Captions aid comprehension and retention for all viewers.

## Understanding Transcription vs. Captioning  

While often used interchangeably, transcription and captioning are distinct:  

- **Transcription**: Converting spoken words into text, focusing solely on what is said.  
- **Captioning**: Includes transcription PLUS auditory cues, speaker identification, and precise timing to sync text with video.  

At Echo Labs, most of your tasks will involve captioning, which provides a more comprehensive viewer experience.

## Echo Labs Style Guide Highlights  

To ensure consistency and professionalism, Echo Labs has specific guidelines for transcription. Below are the key points:  

### Speaker Tags  
- **Format**: Always use brackets and uppercase names, e.g., `[DR. SMITH]`.  
- **Unknown Speakers**: Use descriptive tags like `[STUDENT ONE]`.  
- **Avoid Generic Tags**: Do not use `[SPEAKER ONE]` or `[SPEAKER TWO]`.  
- **Title Hierarchy**: Use professional titles when available, e.g., `[INSTRUCTOR JONES]`.  

### Atmospherics  
Atmospherics capture non-speech sounds like:  
- **Music**: (e.g., `(soft piano music)` or `(upbeat rock music)`)  
- **Sound Effects**: `(door creaking)` or `(audience laughing)`  
- **Unintelligible Sounds**: Use `(unintelligible)` sparingly.  

Avoid subjective descriptors like “beautiful music” or “annoying sound.”  

### Punctuation and Grammar  
- **Ellipses**: Use `...` for long pauses (5 seconds or more).  
- **Dashes**: Use `—` for interruptions mid-sentence.  
- **Quotation Marks**: Use for direct quotes only, e.g., `"The experiment was a success," said Dr. Smith.`  

### Timing and Alignment  
- Sync captions to the exact moment words are spoken.  
- Ensure captions are on-screen long enough to be read.  

### Numbers, Symbols, and Equations  
- Spell out numbers one through ten; use numerals for larger numbers.  
- For math content, use proper symbols (e.g., `+`, `-`, `/`) when spoken.  
- Avoid special characters like `£`; write out their names instead (e.g., "pounds").

## Common Challenges and How to Overcome Them  

### Poor Audio Quality

- Unclaim jobs with over 25% foreign-language content unless qualified.  

### Speaker Overlaps
